# FlashCard

- This project is part of the [Udacity React Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

- The App allows users to study collections of flashcards.
- The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

## NOTE for Review

- **Don't** try to run on the `web`, as the notification package I'm using will produce some errors and the app won't run.
- The app is currenlty testes on `Android` only using `Windows10`. I have no access to `iOS` or `MacOS` sorry for the inconvenience!
